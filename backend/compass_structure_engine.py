"""
REVISION PACKAGE 5 — Structure-Centered Decision Engine (additive simplification).

Replaces the object-selection / evidence-diagnosis logic (Sprint 3 `decide()` +
RP4 controller) for the RP5 instructional path with a single structure-first flow:

    Student Writing
        -> Highest-Priority Structure        (ONE focused selection call)
        -> Canonical Instructional Object     (MINIMAL 5-component retrieval)
        -> Instructional Decision             (authoritative — nothing may override it downstream)
        -> Dialogue Engine                    (builds the structure; never re-decides)

Design commitments (RP5 spec):
  * The Decision Engine is the ONLY component that determines WHAT is taught.
  * Its first job is NOT to diagnose errors — it identifies the ONE structure with
    the greatest developmental leverage (the highest-priority structure not yet
    solidly established for the writer's unit).
  * The Dialogue Engine may explain / scaffold / question / encourage / pace /
    preserve ownership, but it may NOT choose, replace, strengthen, weaken, or
    substitute the instructional target.
  * Minimal retrieval: only five instructional components per structure. No
    historical notes, theoretical rationale, implementation notes, or metadata.

Reuses Sprint 1-4 infrastructure UNCHANGED: persistent InstructionalState, the
evidence/audit collections, and teacher override. No DB / audit / override redesign.
